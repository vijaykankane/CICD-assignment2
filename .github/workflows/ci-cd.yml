# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline for Beginners
# This file should be saved as .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml

name: CI/CD Pipeline

# When to run this workflow
on:
  # Run on every push to main and staging branches
  push:
    branches: [ main, staging ]
  # Run on pull requests to main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  # Run when a release is created (for production deployment)
  release:
    types: [published]

# Define the jobs
